# Coffee Shop Sales Data Analysis & Dashboard
**Project Overview**  
This project is a comprehensive data analysis of sales transactions from a multi-location coffee shop chain over a six-month period (January - June 2025). The goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable business intelligence by identifying key performance indicators, understanding customer purchasing patterns, and providing a dynamic dashboard for operational management. 

The final output is a visualized  Performance Dashboard that highlights revenue trends, product performance, and store efficiency, built upon cleaned and aggregated data.  


**Tools Used**  

- Data Preparation & Analysis: Microsoft Excel
- Visualization & Dashboarding: Spreadsheet tools

**Methodology**  

1. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering:
- Created the Revenue field (Quantity×Unit Price).
- Extracted temporal features (Month, Weekday, Hour) from the transaction date and time fields.
2. Aggregation:
- Used pivot tables to summarize sales metrics by month, store location, and product type.
3. Visualization
-Designed a dashboard layout emphasizing key performance indicators (KPIs) and critical operational insights.

2. **Transaction by Hour of Day:**  
**Insight**:  Customer traffic is highly concentrated in the mid-to-late morning, peaking significantly between 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM. This is the critical two-hour window for optimizing staffing levels and minimizing customer wait times.

3. **Transaction by Product Category:**  
**Insight**: While Coffee and Tea dominate transaction volume, the Barista Espresso product type is the single highest revenue generator. Operational focus should be placed on high-margin espresso drinks.
